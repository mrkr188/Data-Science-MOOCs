# Introduction
  
Data Science is a exiting field and Data Scientists need to be have a broad skillset. To strengthen my understanding in various concepts, as well as get more hands on experience, I have persued many Data Science related MOOCs. This directory contains description of various courses i persued along with the certificates I gained. 

I divide essential skillsets into these following 4 categories and persue courses in areas where I need improvement. 

**Maths** 
* Probability and Statistics
* Linear Algibra
* Calculus

**Programming Skills**
* Python, R programming languages
* Data Structures and Algorithms 

**Systems**
* Relational Databases, SQL
* Hadoop Ecosystem - *HDFS, MapReduce, PIG, Hive*
* NoSQL systems - *HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra*
* Cloud Computing concepts - *Amazon Web Services*

**Data Science Core**
* Data Wrangling, Cleaning, Manipulation and Exploratory Data Analytics
* Machine Learning 
* Information Retrieval
* Data Mining
* Data Visualization
